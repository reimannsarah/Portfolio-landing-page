# _Portfolio Landing Page_

#### By Sarah Reimann
#### _A landing page for my portfolio with links to all my relevant projects._ 

## Technologies Used

* HTML
* CSS


## Description

The is the landing page for my portfolio. It includes an "About" section detailing how I ended up in computer programming and a list of projects complete with links. 

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Clone this repository to your desktop
* Navigate to the top level of the directory
* open index.html in your browser

## Known Bugs

* The spacing on the left side of the page is uneven to the right. This is because I coded the projects as a list and then formatted them into boxes. This problem would likely go away if I formatted each project as a div.
